#### About me
I'm a data engineer with 10+ years of management experience. I am a self-motivated, 
agile, and highly competent analytics professional with repeated success managing 
large sets of data and performing a range of quality checks to ensure accurate 
interpretations and results. I have advanced experience with data mining, data 
pre-processing (i.e. class labeling, data cleansing, dealing with missing values, 
etc.), and case specific. In addition, I'm highly skilled at identifying metrics 
and KPIs, creating reports and dashboards to extract meaningful business insights. 
My interests include corporate data governance, data science, statistics, and 
using visualization tools to provide meaningful business insights.
